			<p>Reading this article on the New York Times about Microsoft&#8217;s decision to remain in Redmont, their plan to expand the 80 building campus further instead of creating a satellite campus somwhere else.</p>
<p>Interesting read, but my thoughts of course drift away to what toodou in a few years might be (well, what topic does not lead me to toodou these days? ) .  It took Microsoft 4 years to grow to 80 employees, and 25 years to reach 25,000.  Building a company organically, it is a life&#8217;s journey.</p>
<p>One life only.  One journey to take.  How glad I have been to finally find a work that i am determined to settle on, and excited and, man, thrilled.  I guess it is the days like this that make the journey worthwhile.<br>[@more@]<br></p>
