			<p><font size="3">Another 4 hours , and year 2006 will be gone.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font size="3">Much accomplished, much to be accomplished.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">I have not updated this blog as regularly as I did before.&nbsp; Much of what I have always wanted to do is now being done everyday.&nbsp; What would you call it? A state of content?&nbsp; Don&#8217;t know, not sure, can&#8217;t be.&nbsp; But in a world of frenziness and actions, words can seem to be too light.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font size="3">But weighty words and thoughts tire a person&#8217;s mind&nbsp;easily and thoroughly.&nbsp; Action in comparison is so much lighter.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Much to think, much to act, much to create and, yes, to destroy in the process.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">I wish all of you a happy new year.&nbsp; Whatever 2007 might bring, it will be a new one like never before, until 2008 comes.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">How many never live to see 2007? And one day, I will not live to see a particular year.&nbsp; In the years between, which we all have, may fate and luck smile on you and me.</font></p>
