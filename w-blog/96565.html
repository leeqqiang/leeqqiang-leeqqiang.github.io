			<p>For some reason, the Chinese input system is not working. Not in the mood of restarting my computer and spending 10 minutes staring at the windows start up program.  </p>
<p>It was snowing.  really hard snowing in the morning.  But luckily not quite so cold as yesterday morning. </p>
<p>Went to da zhao si.  The old temple was badly damaged during cultural revolution.  The new one was rebuilt in the 80s.  Tibetans don&#8217;t need to pay for the entrance fee.  We do.  I guess it&#8217;s a form of taxation for the sins committed by the Han people 40 years ago.  Even though it was snowing very hard, some locals are still doing the long kowtowing in front of the temple gate.  </p>
<p>Went to the Podala Palace.  Well, it&#8217;s supposed to be the most fascinating place in all Lhasa, but to me, it&#8217;s quite boring.  Lots of gold and lots of jewles.  But none of the stubas or statues can be called work of art, in my opinion.  Work of money and work of voluntary donation by average tibetans, but nothing artistically astounding.  </p>
<p>Also checked out Se La temple.  Now this is an interesting place.  We went there to admire the famously expressive debating styles of the resident monks.  But surprise, the monks decided not to do any debating because the weather was not good.  I guess bad weather will deter intellectually superior monks, but not the average believers who would kneel in the rain or snow in front of Podala palace and Da Zhao temple.</p>
<p>Had a really nice dinner at Shambala Hotel, one of the best hotels around in Lhasa.  If I make a return trip back to Lhasa, I would definitely stay in one of these traditionaly Tibetan hotels.  Nice and cozy.  Maybe for a couple nights.  Not the whole trip for sure.  Modern amenities are things that you will start to miss once you are left without them.</p>
<p>Internet is too slow.  </p>
