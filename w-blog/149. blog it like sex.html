			<p><font size="2">Sex must be kept regular, just like blogging. Well, I didn&#8217;t say this.&nbsp; A friend of mine did.&nbsp; I guess you can always stretch everything to make everything sound like just about anything else.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Relaxing it a little bit, just finished watching &quot;Kids Return.&quot; Storyline is pretty much predictable, though the rhythm and music make up a little bit for the banality of the story.&nbsp; Three high school kids, going separate ways, all ended up not so well.&nbsp; But the rather unfortunate thing is, one of the three, the one that is actually really quite normal and shy and everything nice, ended up dead.&nbsp; The baddest kid got hurt the worst, of course. But he is also the one who said, hey, life is just starting.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">What is it about blogging? You have got something that you want to let out of your system.&nbsp; So you just let it out here.&nbsp; What do I care.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t see how that is similar to sex.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Keep it regular.&nbsp; But hell, don&#8217;t keep it routine.</font></p>
