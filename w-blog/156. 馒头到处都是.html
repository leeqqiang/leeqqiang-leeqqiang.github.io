<p>Gay cowboys, it seems, are shaping up to be like &quot;Who&#8217;s on first?&quot; or &quot;the aristocrats&quot;: a joke that keeps on giving. While the &quot;Who wants to see that?&quot; humor columns about <a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=301840&amp;inline=nyt_ttl">&quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;</a> have waned, online parodies of the gay-cowboy movie are still proliferating faster than the curatorial video sites ― including youtube .com, <a href="http://gorillamask.net/" target="_">gorillamask.net</a>, and dailysixer .com (which has a section called &quot;Brokeback Spoofs&quot;) ― can keep up with them. Some of them are stupid. Some are droll and great. But as commentary on the forms and ceremonies of proto-gay relationships, they&#8217;re surprisingly sharp, and worth taking seriously.</p>
<p><a name="secondParagraph"></a>
</p><p>All of the parodies assume the same form: they&#8217;re trailers for imagined mashups that combine elements of &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; with other movies. The actual mashups, of course, don&#8217;t exist; only these trailers do. They&#8217;re made anonymously or by comedy troupes or design shops, like Chocolate Cake City and Robot Rumpus, both of which give their web addresses at the end of their parody videos, &quot;Brokeback to the Future&quot; and &quot;The Empire Breaks Back.&quot; (The creators who stay anonymous might be trying to avoid nagging copyright issues.) </p>
<p>If they&#8217;re well made, the parodies can presumably serve as a calling card for those who sign their work; some of them are viewed hundreds of thousands of times. Generally, though, the &quot;Brokeback&quot; spoofs are nothing but labors of love, or gay panic, or both.</p>
<p>The parodies typically use Gustavo Santaolalla&#8217;s sexy, mournful theme from &quot;Brokeback Mountain,&quot; together with the title cards from that movie&#8217;s trailer, to reframe clips from another movie. It works almost every time: a gay movie seems to emerge when scenes between male leads, or a male lead and a supporting actor, are slowed down, set to make-out music and bumpered by portentous cards that say things like, &quot;A truth they couldn&#8217;t deny.&quot; The editing, and the use of slow motion, do suggest that close-ups, especially viewed at length, are intrinsically erotic. All that these parodies need to do to set up the relationship is show one man&#8217;s face in protracted detail, and cut to the other man, who seems to watch with the same rapt attention that the viewer has been compelled to give by the slow-mo. A gay subtext suddenly seems plain as day.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s more adroit about these parodies is the use they make of the dialogue from the movie they&#8217;re mashing up with &quot;Brokeback.&quot; Very little &quot;Brokeback&quot; dialogue has been repurposed here, with the exception of two of the ranch hand Jack Twist&#8217;s impassioned lines &quot;It&#8217;s nobody&#8217;s business but ours,&quot; and &quot;God, I wish I knew how to quit you!&quot; ― which turn up now and then when a parodist gives up trying to make the point another way. Most of the parodists don&#8217;t give up, though, and strive to tease a gay plot out of what&#8217;s already in the older movies, all of which, unlike &quot;Brokeback Mountain,&quot; are already available on DVD, so they can be manipulated using software like iMovie.</p>
<p>These movies ― <a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/titlelist.html?v_idlist=135459;169666;21934;21935;138104&amp;inline=nyt_ttl">&quot;Heat,&quot;</a> <a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=9753&amp;inline=nyt_ttl">&quot;City Slickers,&quot;</a> <a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/titlelist.html?v_idlist=158894;174347;113936;158905;50122&amp;inline=nyt_ttl">&quot;Titanic,&quot;</a> <a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=180767&amp;inline=nyt_ttl">&quot;Fight Club&quot;</a> ― throw up plenty of evocative lines for use by the parodists. Almost every scene in which a wiser man is trying to encourage a na&iuml;f to follow his dreams, for example, seems to double as a gay dialogue. &quot;Stop trying to control everything, and just let go, let go!&quot; Tyler Durden (<a title="" href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=56988&amp;inline=nyt-per">Brad Pitt</a>) says to <a title="" href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=215904&amp;inline=nyt-per">Edward Norton&#8217;s</a> unnamed character in &quot;Fight Club.&quot; In the &quot;Brokeback&quot; parody, the line seems to be part of a pushy seduction. In the &quot;The Empire Breaks Back,&quot; Anakin Skywalker says: &quot;Something&#8217;s happening. I want more, and I know I shouldn&#8217;t.&quot; At another time, Palpatine advises him: &quot;In time, you will learn to trust your feelings.&quot; When the lines are run together in the parody, they again work convincingly as a love scene.</p>
<p>Other Hollywood-hero problems, put in new context, seem like cries from the heart by gay men. In <a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=38541&amp;inline=nyt_ttl">&quot;Point Break,&quot;</a> <a title="" href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=59355&amp;inline=nyt-per">Keanu Reeves&#8217;s</a> character, Johnny Utah, wails, &quot;I can&#8217;t describe what I&#8217;m feeling&quot;; when this line comes in &quot;Point Brokeback,&quot; the parody, it seems to express Johnny&#8217;s inability to face his gay desires. (For frisson, or maybe for authenticity, some of the parodies use scenes with actors, like Mr. Reeves and <a title="" href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=93341&amp;inline=nyt-per">Tom Hanks</a>, who have played gay characters in other movies.) </p>
<p>A problem of the traditional sci-fi hero, particularly the time traveler, is that he can&#8217;t describe his relationships to other people; if he&#8217;s traveled back in time, can he be his mother&#8217;s contemporary? This is true for Marty McFly, Michael J. Fox&#8217;s character in <a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=3671&amp;inline=nyt_ttl">&quot;Back to the Future,&quot;</a> which was one of the first movies to appear in a mashup parody with &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; (predictably: &quot;Brokeback to the Future&quot;). In the scene that the parodists borrow, Marty introduces Dr. Brown (<a title="" href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=42805&amp;inline=nyt-per">Christopher Lloyd</a>), saying, &quot;This is my ― uh ― Doc. My uncle. Doc!&quot; In the new framework, this introduction sounds like the confused, stammering introduction that a closeted young man might make of his older boyfriend, whom he&#8217;s trying to pass off as a boss, an associate, an uncle. </p>
<p>Similarly, when Frodo (<a title<br="">
="" href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=77309&amp;inline=nyt-per">Elijah Wood</a>), introduces Sam (<a title="" href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=2649&amp;inline=nyt-per">Sean Astin</a>) in the appealing &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; mashup, he&#8217;s asked, &quot;Your bodyguard?&quot; Sam corrects him, &quot;His gardener.&quot; </p>
<p>Nearly 60 years ago, Leslie Fiedler argued that the great American novels of the 19th century dramatize a love story between men, typically a white man and a man of color: Ishmael and Queequeg, Natty Bumppo and Chingachgook, Huck and Jim. He made his brilliant academic career on this startling thesis, which he went on to demonstrate in &quot;Love and Death in the American Novel&quot; in 1960. Now Fiedler&#8217;s thesis seems to apply to Hollywood movies as well, but the thorough close-readings that have refined and broadened Fiedler&#8217;s argument this time have been provided not by graduate students, but by online pranksters using little more than laptops, a broadband connection and Final Cut Pro. </p>
<p>My favorite of the parodies, however, didn&#8217;t require much technology or even editing, just a good sense of double entendre scenes of emotional intensity between men. It&#8217;s the &quot;Brokeback&quot; mashup with &quot;Heat,&quot; the underrated <a title="" href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=101066&amp;inline=nyt-per">Michael Mann</a> movie with <a title="" href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=54596&amp;inline=nyt-per">Al Pacino</a> and <a title="" href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=17593&amp;inline=nyt-per">Robert De Niro</a>. &quot;Heat&quot; was a psychological tango movie, with the alpha actors playing a police detective, Vincent, and a bad guy, Neil, respectively. They&#8217;re supposed to be talking about the cops-and-robbers life, but in &quot;Brokeback Heat,&quot; which just replays without legerdemain a whole scene between them, they seem for all the world to be talking about their love, and gay love generally, and their unwillingness to be straight.</p>
<p>&quot;So then, if you spot me coming around that corner, you just gonna walk out on this woman?&quot; Vincent asks. &quot;Not say goodbye?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;That&#8217;s the discipline,&quot; Neil says.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#8217;s pretty vacant, you know,&quot; Vincent says.</p>
<p>&quot;It is what it is,&quot; Neil replies. &quot;It&#8217;s that or we&#8217;d both better go do something else, pal.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t know how to do anything else,&quot; Vincent says.</p>
<p>&quot;Neither do I,&quot; Neil says.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t much want to either,&quot; Vincent says.</p>
<p>&quot;Neither do I,&quot; Neil says.</p>
<p>Taken straight or as a sendup, this is simply Mr. Pacino and Mr. De Niro playing a smoldering scene. And what they mean by it is no business but theirs. </p>
