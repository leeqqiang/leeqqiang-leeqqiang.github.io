<p>This story isn&#8217;t for the faint of heart. In fact, we wouldn&#8217;t really recommend it for anybody, but we&#8217;ll soldier on regardless. Thomas Martel hails from Colorado, and after upgrading to an iPhone, he decided his big hands were just too much of a burden to bear. &#8220;From my old Treo, to my Blackberry, to this new iPhone, I had a hard time hitting the right buttons, and I always lost those little styluses,&#8221; says Martel. So what&#8217;s a man to do? Why, get those digits downsized, of course. Thomas went under the knife for a new technique called &#8220;whittling.&#8221; The doctors made a small cut in each thumb and shaved down the bones, then they adjusted the muscles and fingernails to fit the new thumb size. Martel&#8217;s new thumbs look a tad effeminate, and there&#8217;s always that problem of expense and general discomfort, but he thinks the procedure &#8220;will pay for itself in ten to fifteen years. And what it&#8217;s saving me in frustration &#8211; that&#8217;s priceless.&#8221; Whatever you say, Thomas.</p>
<p>Update: InformationWeek is reporting this story as false. North Denver News hasn&#8217;t pulled it yet, but given the far-fetched nature, we&#8217;re certainly having doubts of its authenticity. Either way, we don&#8217;t recommend you running out and getting your thumbs whittled any time soon.</p>
