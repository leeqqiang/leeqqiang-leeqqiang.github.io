			<p><font size="2"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/27/science/27eins.html?pagewanted=1&amp;incamp=article_popular_1">Today&#8217;s article on the New York Times</a>, about scientists proving through an experiment that, whenever an atom out of a pair gets mesaured, the other will instantly change its properties, be it across the room or across the universe.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">I&#8217;m gonna have harder and harder time reading this sort of articles from now on.&nbsp; Managed to finish &quot;the Elegant Universe&quot;, the book about string theory, already with considerable difficulties.&nbsp; But at least I could still imagine the universe or the parallel universes through the pictures conjuered up by&nbsp;the author.&nbsp; The other book that I have read&nbsp;that requires a lot of thought and brain energy,&nbsp;How the Mind Works, is actually easy.&nbsp; Many examples given are very hard to grasp initially, but at least, intuition works.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Now, how&nbsp;do you imagine a world where you can be here and there, now and&nbsp;future, anything and nothing.&nbsp; And weirder still, when any of these states gets observed, the rest will instantaneously change too? The message sent&nbsp;across a void.&nbsp; And&nbsp;the weirdest of all,&nbsp;the change is done instantly.&nbsp; Now,&nbsp;there is no need for speed here!</font></p>
<p><font size="2">So, by instinct and one of the&nbsp;examples given that can still be explained through instinct,&nbsp;I guess I can imagine that the worlds are like pancakes, layered on top of one another.&nbsp; These pairs of atoms, when observerd through this universe, are far&nbsp;apart, but in their actual state, they are actually connected, directly connected?</font></p>
<p><font size="2">What if&nbsp;you cannot even imagine the world&nbsp;with instinct?&nbsp; How do you cope with that?</font>&nbsp;</p>
