</p><p>Online confessors are like flashers. They exhibit<br>
themselves anonymously and publicly, with little consideration for you,<br>
the audience. Browse some of the confessionals on the Web: grouphug.us<br>
(a simple log), <a target="_" href="http://notproud.com/">notproud.com</a> (organized by deadly sin) or <a target="_" href="http://dailyconfession.com/">dailyconfession.com</a> (where you can barely find the confessions for all the promotional stuff). You can see for yourself. </p>
<p>One online confessional, though, breaks the mold. At PostSecret, found at <a target="_" href="http://postsecret.blogspot.com/">postsecret.blogspot.com</a>,<br>
the confessions are consistently engaging, original and well told. How<br>
come? The Web site gives people simple instructions. Mail your secret<br>
anonymously on one side of a 4-by-6-inch postcard that you make<br>
yourself. That one constraint is a great sieve. It strains out lazy,<br>
impulsive confessors.</p>
<p><a name="secondParagraph"></a></p>
<p>For PostSecret, you write,<br>
type or paste your secret on a postcard, and then, if you want,<br>
decorate the card with drawings or photographs. Next the stamp and then<br>
the mailbox. Yes, it&#8217;s work to confess. And it should be, if only for<br>
the sake of the person who might be listening.</p>
<p>One message says:<br>
&quot;I lied&quot; under the word &quot;oath.&quot; Another says, &quot;I deleted the pope&#8217;s<br>
funeral unwatched off my TiVO to make room for an episode of<br>
&#8216;Survivor.&#8217; &quot; The postcard picture &#8211; a split image, top half funeral,<br>
bottom half &#8216;Survivor&#8217; &#8211; captures the moment of sin. </p>
<p>Some<br>
secrets cannot be separated from the cards they&#8217;re on. One sad little<br>
postcard has a lineup of seven 3-cent stamps, each with a picture of a<br>
Conestoga wagon on it, plus one 2-cent stamp of a locomotive: &quot;I found<br>
these stamps as a child, and I have been waiting all my life to have<br>
someone to send them to. I never did have someone.&quot; </p>
<p>The<br>
following typed message was pasted onto a card made out of a $50<br>
parking ticket: &quot;I got a parking citation and so did the car next to<br>
me. I replaced the ticket on the car next to me with mine. My ticket<br>
got paid. And the one I took? I mailed it to PostSecret.&quot; It isn&#8217;t so<br>
much a confession as a live performance of sin. </p>
<p>PostSecret is<br>
simple to navigate. You scroll down to read one postcard after another.<br>
There&#8217;s little else on the site. O.K., you will occasionally run into<br>
little self-congratulatory landmarks: announcements that PostSecret<br>
will be onstage in Melbourne, Australia, newspaper clippings from all<br>
over the world, scores of compliments from readers. But basically it&#8217;s<br>
all secrets. </p>
<p>And the secrets are regularly refreshed. Each<br>
Sunday, Frank, the keeper of the secrets, posts a new batch straight<br>
from his mailbox in Germantown, Md., and removes some old ones from the<br>
site. One virtue of the resulting chronological lineup is that you can<br>
look for patterns emerging, certain kinds of confessions clumping<br>
together. And clump they do. </p>
<p>For instance, the most recent<br>
confessions tend to be the most graphically and ethically hip. They<br>
look like the work of Barbara Kruger, Damien Hirst or Sophie Calle. &quot;I<br>
want to be anorexic,&quot; says one card with a photo of a skeletal woman,<br>
&quot;but I can&#8217;t stop eating.&quot;</p>
<p>And for some reason many of the<br>
secrets posted on May 8 follow a certain form, a confession followed by<br>
a coda with a dash more guilt: &quot;I don&#8217;t care about recycling. (But I<br>
pretend I do.)&quot; &quot;I had sex with strangers for money. And I liked it.&quot;<br>
&quot;I hate loving families&#8230; Because I don&#8217;t have one.&quot;</p>
<p>One odd<br>
thing about PostSecret is that there&#8217;s a real disconnection between<br>
what the confessions are and what the readers think they are. One<br>
reader from Texas wrote, &quot;Thank you so much for building a window into<br>
so many souls, even if it only shines light on the darkest part.&quot; A<br>
reader in Australia wrote: &quot;Each is a silent prayer of hope, love,<br>
fear, joy, pain, sorrow, guilt, happiness, hatred, confidence,<br>
strength, weakness and a million other things that we all share as<br>
human beings&#8230; there is no fakeness here.&quot; </p>
<p>No fakeness? Oh,<br>
but there is. And it is the fakeness, the artifice and the performance<br>
that make this confessional worth peeking at. The secret sharers here<br>
aren&#8217;t mindless flashers but practiced strippers. They don&#8217;t want to<br>
get rid of their secrets. They love them. They arrange them. They tend<br>
them. They turn them into fetishes. And that&#8217;s the secret of<br>
PostSecret. It isn&#8217;t really a true confessional after all. It is a<br>
piece of collaborative art.</p>
